# 2 DOF Planar Robot Arm Inverse Kinematics

This project provides the inverse kinematics equations for a 2 Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) planar robot arm. These equations calculate the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) required to position the end-effector at a specific point \((p_x, p_y)\) in a 2D plane. Using to draw "21ECE" (on-going)
